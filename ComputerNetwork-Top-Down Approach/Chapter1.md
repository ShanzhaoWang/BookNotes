## 1. What is the Internet?

### 1.1 “Nuts and bolts" view 具体细节，基本要素
* Millions of connected computing devices:
  * **hosts** = end systems 主机
  * running network apps
* Communication Links:
  * Fiber, Copper, Radio, Satellite
  * Transmission Rate: `bandwidth` 带宽
* Packet Switches (包交换）: forward packets(chunks of data)
  * **routers and switches**
* Internet: "network of networks"
  * Interconnected `ISPs (Internet Service Providers) 互联网服务供应商`
* **Protocols** control sending, receiving of msgs (A rule to operate)
  * e.g. TCP, IP, HTTTP, Skype, 802.11
* Internet Standards
  * RFC: Request for Comments
  * IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
  * Did you guys check out the webpage?
### 1.2 A Service Desceription
* `Infrastructure` - that provides services to applications:
  - Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, social nets, ...
* Provides programming interface to apps:
  - Hooks that allow sending and receving app programs to "connect" to Internet
  - Provides service options, analogous to postal service
### 1.3 What Is a Protocol?
* Human Protocols:
  * Question format
  * Introduction method
* Network Protocols:
  * Machines rather than humans
  * all 
> Protocols define `format`, `order` of msgs sent and received among network entities, and `actions taken` on msg transmission, receipt

## 2. Network edge
*
### 2.1 Access Networks
* DSL(digital subscriber line):
  *
* Cable Network:
  * FDM
* Home Networks:
* Enterprise( Ethernet)
* Wireless access networks
  
### 2.2 Physical media(P21)
* Guided Media
  * 
* Unguided Media

## 3. Network Core
* Mesh of interconnected routers
* Providing a path between source and destination through shared network resources
### 3.3 A network of networks (Internet Structure)
* How to connect ISPs together?
### 3.1 Packet Switching
* Hosts break application-layer messages into packets
* routing:
* forwarding:

### 3.2 Circuit Switching
* TDM:
* FDM:

## 4. Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

* Throughput(Bandwidth)
* Delay (Latency)
* Queueing Delay


* Jitter
* Delay X Throughput (Calculation)


## 5. Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
### 5.1 Layered Architecture
a. Networks are complex with many "pieces": hosts, routers, links of various media, applications, protocols, hardware, software  
b. **layers:** each layer implements a service
  * via its own internal-layer actions
  * relying on services provided by layer below  
c. Why layering? -- Dealing with complex systems:
* Explicit structure allows identification, relationship of complex   
d. Internet protocol stack  
e. The OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) model:
* Addititonal two layers to five Internet Protocol Stack
  *
