* Describe the differences among short-term, medium-term, and long-term scheduling.
 * Short-term (CPU scheduler): selects from jobs in memory those jobs that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to them
 * Medium-term: used especially with time-sharing systems as an intermediate scheduling level. 
  * A swapping scheme is implemented to remove partially run programs from memory and reinstate them later to continue where they left off.
 * Long-term(job scheduler) - determines which jobs are brought into memory for processing.

6.1 
* A CPU-scheduling algorithm determines an order for the execution of its scheduled processes. Given n processes to be scheduled on one processor, how many different schedules are possible? Give a formula in terms of n.
  * n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1 = n!
  
6.2 (Page 7-8)
* Explain the difference between preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling.
