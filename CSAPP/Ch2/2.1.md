## Information Storage

* Rather than accessing individual bits in memory, most computers use `blocks of eight bits`, or bytes, as the `smallest addressable unit of memory`.
* A machinelevel program views memory as a very large array of bytes, referred to as virtual
memory.

### 3. Addressing and Byte Ordering 寻址和字节顺序
* a multi-byte object is stored as a contiguous sequence of bytes, with the address of the object given by the smallest address of the bytes
used. 
  * int x (32位) 地址为 `&x = 0x100`，那么x的4个字节将被存储在内存的`0x100`,`0x101`,`0x102`和`0x103`位置

* The C formatting directive `“%.2x”` indicates that an integer should be printed in hexadecimal with at least two digits.

### 2.1.7 位级运算
* 掩码运算：这里掩码是一个位模式，表示从一个字中选出的位的集合。
  * 0xFF（最低的8位为1）表示一个字的低位字节。
  * 位级运算`x&0xFF`生成一个由x的最低有效字节组成的值
  > the mask 0xFF (having ones for the least significant 8 bits) indicates the low-order byte of a word. The bit-level operation x & 0xFF yields a value consisting of the least significant byte of x, but with all other bytes set to 0. For example, with x = 0x89ABCDEF, the expression would yield 0x000000EF.
